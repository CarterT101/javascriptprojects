 # JavaScript Projects
## My JavaScript projects assigned to me by The Tech Academy
In this JavaScript repository, I made multiple projects including: a Pizza Menu, a Tic-Tac-Toe game, and a Calculator.

In the [Pizza Menu project](https://github.com/CarterT101/javascriptprojects/tree/main/Basic_JavaScript_Projects/Pizza%20Menu), I created a basic pizza menu where you can order various sizes of pizzas, and include toppings such as meats and vegetables and it will add them all up and display a price. 

For the [Tic-Tac-Toe game](https://github.com/CarterT101/javascriptprojects/tree/main/Basic_JavaScript_Projects/TicTacToe), you can play against a computer which randomly selects a spot on the classic game.

The [Calculator project](https://github.com/CarterT101/javascriptprojects/tree/main/Basic_JavaScript_Projects/Calculator) is a basic calculator in which you can do addition, subtract, multiplication, and divisio on a custom looking calculator.
