## My JavaScript projects assigned to me by The Tech Academy
In this JavaScript repository, I made multiple projects including: a Pizza Menu, a Tic-Tac-Toe gmae, and a Calculator.

In the Pizza Menu project, I created a basic pizza menu where you can order various sizes of pizzas, and include toppings such as meats and vegetables and it will add them all up and display a price. 

For the Tic-Tac-Toe game, you can play against a computer which randomly selects a spot on the classic game.

The Calculator project is a basic calculator in which you can do addition, subtract, multiplication, and divisio on a custom looking calculator.
